As we wrap things up, WECS is once again honoured to offer a wide variety of Final Exam Review Sessions to help you feel as confident as possible going into your exams. Keep reading for the full list of upcoming sessions—plus a few extra surprises along the way. From all of us, we wish you a fantastic exam semester.

As campus bursts into colour—from daffodils to cherry blossoms (and that one dramatic purple tree by the fountain)—WECS is here to help you bloom too! We’ve got exciting opportunities, incredible events, and more coming your way! So grab your sunglasses, find a sunny spot on the quad, and dive in.`,
